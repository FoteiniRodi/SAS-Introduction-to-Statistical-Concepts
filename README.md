# SAS-Introduction-to-Statistical-Concepts

This course covers basic statistical concepts that are critical for understanding and using statistical methods. This course explains what statistics is and why it is important to understand the characteristics of your data.

The information in this course is a prerequisite for many other statistical courses that SAS Education offers. The course is appropriate for Base SAS and SAS Enterprise Guide users. Data, practices, and a case study are included.

Learn how to
examine data distributions
obtain and interpret sample statistics using the UNIVARIATE and MEANS procedures
examine data distributions graphically in the UNIVARIATE and SGPLOT procedures
construct confidence intervals
perform simple tests of hypothesis.
